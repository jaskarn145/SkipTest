Coding test
 
The task is to create an application that accepts an outcode as a parameter. The application should
then display the following information about each restaurant that delivers to that outcode by
querying our API:
● Name;
● Rating;
● Types of food for the restaurant.

Task requirements
Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following
requirements have been met:
● Create a React Native application;
● Complete the user stories below;
● Your code should compile and run in one step;
● You must include tests;

User Stories
As a user running the application
I can view a list of restaurants in a user submitted outcode (e.g. SE19)
So that I know which restaurants are currently available.
As a user running the application
I can view the restaurant logo alongside restaurant information
So that I know exactly which restaurants are currently available.
As a user running the application
I can tap on a restaurant
So that I can see additional information about it
Acceptance criteria:
● For the known outcode ec4m, results are returned;
● The name, cuisine types and rating of the restaurant are displayed;
● For the restaurant additional information, address, opening and delivery times and deals are
displayed.
